# Puszta Browser

A couple months ago, I started wondering *"How do these web browsers we use every day even work?"*. <br>
Then I stumbled upon [this wonderful tutorial](https://browser.engineering/), and figured I could give it a shot!
Ofcourse me being me, I didn't just follow the tutorial like I should've - No siree! Instead I decided to follow it in C++ via GLFW and FreeType for text rendering and OpenSSL for... well, SSL. 
<br> This was a great mistake (C++ is *not* a fun language), but in the end I managed to create this:
<br>A fully functioning DIY web browser/HTML renderer! And it runs on Windows 7 - Not even Chrome or Firefox can do that anymore ;)

### But what amazing features does this browser have?
I'm glad you asked! This browser has cutting edge features like:
- HTTP 1.1 support
- HTTPS support (with full SSL!)
- Redirects
- Browser history (we don't save it though - your secrets are safe with us ðŸ˜‰)
- Full Unicode support!
- Variable fonts
- Local file loading (file:///)
- view-source
- An HTML renderer capable of rendering most webpages
- A modern and stylish UI with dark AND light mode via ImGui

Check out the rest of the wonderful features on [the Puszta Browser website](https://puszta.laky2k8.hu/).

# How to build
<br>
Set up GLFW, GLAD, ImGui, FreeTyoe and OpenSSL in any development environment you like. Then just build the project!
<br>

**WARNING: I only tested the code on Windows. I can not guarantee that it will build on Linux or Mac OS.**
<br>
<br>
# How to run
<br>
Just download the release zip, unzip it and run <code>PusztaBrowser.exe</code>. <br>
You can customize the font used by replacing <code>Regular.ttf</code> and <code>Italic.ttf</code>.
<br>
<br>
Here is it running on some platforms: <br><br>
